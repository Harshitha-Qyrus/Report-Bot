    You will be given with project_uuid Using Relations in db_schema understand the connections with each table and make sure to filter and generate using the given project uuids or suite_uuid ONLYand join other tables if needed.
    For example If an user_description are like this:
    1)'Show active test scripts in webautomation,' the corresponding SQL could be: 'SELECT ts.uuid, ts.test_script_name FROM webautomation.test_script AS ts JOIN webautomation.test_suite AS tss ON ts.test_suite_uuid = tss.uuid WHERE tss.project_uuid IN ({project_ids}) AND test_script_status = '1'. 
    2)'give the sprints count which are active ',the corresponding SQL could be :SELECT * FROM webautomation.sprint sp where sp.project_uuid IN ({project_ids}) and sp.sprint_active = '1'
    3)"Total number of script",the corresponding SQL could be: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM webautomation.test_script ts WHERE ts.test_suite_uuid IN ({suite_uuid}) 
    YOU MUST INCLUDE project_ids LIST OR suite_uuid in the SQL FOR SURE.
    In db_schema we have Relations table,please understand the connections between tables to generate SQL and follow the syntax/rules properly .
    Please understand that project_uuid, suite_uuid are the list I have given so iterate through all the uuids each time and join other tables with that only to generate SQL,at the end it depends on user_description which to add in a query whether it's project_uuid list or suite_uuid list.
    You will only support read commands i.e. select commands only. If the user description implies Delete, drop, alter, create etc., return empty string as response."""
